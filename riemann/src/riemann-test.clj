; Riemann offers two helpful functions for unit testing.
; The first is `tap`. The tap function records all the events that
; pass through it.
; You can use it like this:
;
;  (streams
;     (where* is-nan?
;        (tap :nan)))
;
; This sets up a tap called :nan inside our where stream. We can use that to
; check that an event with a metric value of NaN is matched by the is-nan? 
; function.
;
; The other useful function is `io`. The io function swallows events and throws them in the bit-bucket
; when riemann is running in test mode.
; eg.
;
;  (streams
;     (io influx))
;
; will *not* call the influx stream when running unit tests, this is useful to prevent spamming
; slack and pagerduty while testing. When riemann is not running in test mode, the io function 
; just passes events to its children.

          ; the `is` function performs an assertion.
          ; in this case, we're just testing that true == true.

         ; The inject function puts an list of events into the riemann queue
         ; and returns a map of all the taps and the events that
         ; reached them.
         ; eg. using the config from the top of this file, if we injected 
         ;
         ; [ 
         ;   {:service "myservice" :metric Double/NaN}
         ;   {:service "myservice" :metric 10.0 }
         ; ]
         ;
         ; the return value would be
         ; {
         ;    :nan [{:service "myservice" :metric Double/NaN}]
         ; }
         ;
         ; The get function takes a key and a map and returns the matching
         ; value, if any.
         ; eg. If mymap contains the above map, then
         ;
         ; (get mymap :nan)
         ;
         ; returns the list [{:service "myservice" :metric Double/NaN}]

          ; Here we inject a single event into riemann and check that it ends up in a tap
          ; named influx.
          ;
